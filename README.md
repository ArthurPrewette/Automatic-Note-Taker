# Automatic-Note-Taker
Generates OCR-enabled PDF's, Audio transcriptions, and Text Records of online lectures without user-intervention. 

I wrote this program in March of 2021 during Covid when lectures were all online and professors wouldn't record lectures or post lecture material.
This program is best if used in addition to taking notes during lectures so you can go back and see what you missed. 
In all reality, if you didnt attend a lecture there is no way you are going to go back and read the notes this generates for you.
